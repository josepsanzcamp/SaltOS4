/**
 * Make Log function
 *
 * This function adds a log register to the associated log table for each
 * application.
 *
 * @app    => code of the application where you want to add the log
 * @reg_id => register of the app where you want to add the log
 * @log    => the log message that you want to add to the log register
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * This function returns an integer as response about the control action:
 *
 * +1 => insert executed, this is because the app register exists and the control register not exists
 * -1 => app not found, this is because the app requested not have a table in the apps config
 * -2 => log table not found, this is because the has_log feature is disabled by dbstatic
