=Push Log=

==Description==

The Push Log application records all push notifications triggered by the system.
These notifications are typically sent to users to alert them about actions, updates, or system events in real time.
This module allows administrators to monitor the flow of notifications and diagnose potential issues in the delivery process.

==List view==

- Target: Destination user, channel, or group the notification was sent to.
- Status: Indicates whether the delivery was successful or failed.

It includes:

- Datetime: Exact time the push event was triggered.
- Type: Nature of the push (e.g., background alert, user-facing message).
- Message: Full content of the notification.
- Target: User or endpoint to which the message was addressed.
- Status: Delivery result (sent, failed, pending).
- Metadata: Any technical details logged during processing (headers, tokens, etc.).


==Delete==

Push log entries are generally not deleted and are kept for audit purposes.

In specific maintenance scenarios, old records may be purged, but this requires explicit permissions.
