=Push Log=

==Description==

The Push Log application records all push notifications triggered by the system.
These notifications are typically sent to users to alert them about actions, updates, or system events in real time.
This module allows administrators to monitor the flow of notifications and diagnose potential issues in the delivery process.

The following fields are displayed in the list view:

- User: User who triggered or received the push notification.
- Datetime: Date and time when the push notification was recorded.
- Type: Category of the push message (e.g., info, warning, error).


==View entry==

This view shows full details of a single push notification.

It includes:

- User: User who triggered or received the push notification.
- Datetime: Date and time when the push notification was recorded.
- Type: Category of the push message (e.g., info, warning, error).
- Message: Content or summary of the push message sent.

Push log entries are generally not deleted and are kept for audit purposes.

In specific maintenance scenarios, old records may be purged, but this requires explicit permissions.
