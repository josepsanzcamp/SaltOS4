=Trash Log=

==Description==

The Trash Log application records all deletions performed in the system, acting as a recycle bin for SaltOS4.
It allows administrators and advanced users to inspect what data has been removed, when, by whom, and from where.
This module is key for auditability and helps identify accidental deletions or unauthorized actions.

==View entry==

This view displays all recorded information about a deleted item.

It includes:

- Old ID: Original identifier of the record before deletion.
- User: User who performed the deletion.
- Datetime: Exact date and time when the record was deleted.
- Reg ID: Internal registry ID assigned to the deleted record.
- App: Application or module from which the record was removed.

Trash log entries cannot be deleted directly from the interface.

SaltOS4 retains them for accountability and legal traceability unless automatic pruning is configured.
