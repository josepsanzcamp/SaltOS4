+Trash Log+

++Description++

The Trash Log application records all deletions performed in the system, acting as a recycle bin for SaltOS4.
It allows administrators and advanced users to inspect what data has been removed, when, by whom, and from where.
This module is key for auditability and helps identify accidental deletions or unauthorized actions.

++List view++

- Datetime: When the deletion occurred.
- User: Who deleted the record.
- Table: Database table from which the record was removed.
- Record ID: Identifier of the deleted entry.
- Summary: Textual representation of the deleted content.

It includes:

- Datetime: Exact timestamp of the deletion.
- User: Account that triggered the deletion.
- Table: Technical name of the table affected.
- Record ID: Primary key of the deleted entry.
- Summary: Main data content or description of the record.
- Source: App or context where the deletion was performed.
- IP Address: Origin of the deletion action (if tracked).


++Delete++

Trash log entries cannot be deleted directly from the interface.

SaltOS4 retains them for accountability and legal traceability unless automatic pruning is configured.
