==Description==

The Invoices Status application allows you to define the different states that an invoice can go through during its lifecycle.
These statuses help distinguish between draft, issued, paid, or cancelled invoices, enabling better financial tracking and reporting.

Common statuses may include "Draft", "Pending", "Paid", or "Cancelled".
