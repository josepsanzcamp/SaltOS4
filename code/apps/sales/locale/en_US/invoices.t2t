The invoicing application (`invoices`) publishes several widgets on the main dashboard to provide a real-time overview of the system's billing status.

The available widgets are:

- **Table `last_7_invoices`**: shows the 7 most recent invoices, including key information such as customer, total amount, and payment status.
- **Chart `invoice_total_by_day`**: displays the total amount invoiced per day, highlighting peaks and activity trends.
- **Chart `invoice_avg_by_day`**: shows the average daily invoice amount, useful for evaluating consistency or seasonality.
- **Chart `top5_customers_by_total`**: highlights the top 5 customers by billing volume, helping identify key accounts.
- **Chart `invoice_paid_vs_pending`**: compares the number of paid vs. pending invoices, giving insight into payment flow.
- **Chart `invoice_avg_days_to_pay`**: shows the average number of days customers take to pay their invoices, helping assess payment behavior.


These widgets offer useful visual insights for decision-making and allow continuous monitoring of the business's financial evolution.
