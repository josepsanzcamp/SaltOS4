==Description==

The Invoices application is used to issue and manage customer billing records.
Each invoice contains product or service lines, quantities, unit prices, taxes, and discounts.
This module supports both pro forma and finalized invoices, tracks payment status,
and integrates with the Customers, Products, and Taxes modules.
It also provides traceability for due dates, payment dates, and links to related documents.
