++Description++

The Departments application is used to define the organizational structure of the company by grouping employees into departments.
It supports hierarchies, allowing a department to belong to a parent department, and helps organize users and permissions accordingly.

Examples of departments include "Sales", "IT", "HR", or "Logistics".
