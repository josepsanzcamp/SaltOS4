==Description==

This application allows users to configure the content shown on the **SaltOS4 dashboard**.
It is not a traditional app with records, but a visual, user-focused interface for customizing quick access buttons, sections, and widgets that appear on the home dashboard.

Each user can have their own personalized dashboard, and this tool is its visual editor.

The screen displays a canvas-style layout where dashboard elements can be added, arranged, and grouped visually.

Available elements include:

- **Buttons**: Quick access links to apps or features.
- **Separators**: Visual lines or spaces to structure the layout.
- **Titles**: Headers to organize sections of the dashboard.
- **Widgets**: Dynamic components such as calendar, email, charts, stats, etc.


Elements can be grouped, reordered via drag and drop, and arranged into multiple blocks or columns.

==Features==

- Add or remove dashboard elements
- Reorder using drag and drop
- Edit section titles and labels
- Choose which widgets to display
- Organize layout in multiple columns or groups


Changes are saved automatically and apply only to the active userâ€™s dashboard.

==Advanced usage==

This module is ideal for:

- Creating role-specific dashboards (e.g., sales, tech, admin)
- Displaying only frequently used tools and information
- Improving clarity and efficiency on the SaltOS4 start screen
