=Dashboard=

==Description==

The **dashboard** is the main landing screen in SaltOS4, where users can display quick access buttons, separators, widgets, charts, and other visual elements.
It is not a traditional app with forms or records, but rather a dynamic, customizable view designed to provide an overview and fast access to frequent actions.

This screen centralizes commonly used tools and relevant system information.

==Main view==

The dashboard can include:

- Quick access **buttons** to apps or actions
- **Titles** grouping sections of content
- **Separators** to visually organize the layout
- **Widgets** displaying live content (e.g., calendar, email, statistics)


==Dashboard configuration==

In the **top right corner**, there is a gear icon that opens the **dashboard configuration app**.

From there, users can customize their dashboard:

- Select the active dashboard
- Add or remove **buttons**
- Create **titles** and **visual separators**
- Group elements together in logical blocks
- Include any available **widgets** (e.g., mail, analytics, alerts)


This configuration is user-specific and saved automatically.
