==Description==

The Quotes Status application is used to define the different states that a sales quote can have during its lifecycle.
These statuses help sales teams track progress, filter records, and identify which quotes are active, accepted, rejected, or archived.

Examples of common statuses include "Draft", "Sent", "Accepted", and "Declined".
