=Quotes Status=

==Description==

The Quotes Status application is used to define the different states that a sales quote can have during its lifecycle.
These statuses help sales teams track progress, filter records, and identify which quotes are active, accepted, rejected, or archived.

Examples of common statuses include "Draft", "Sent", "Accepted", and "Declined".

==List view==

The following fields are displayed in the list view:

- Name: Label of the status (e.g., Draft, Accepted).
- Description: Explanation of when this status is applied.
- Active: Indicates whether the status is selectable in the Quotes module.

This view is used to create, view or edit quote status entries.

In **create** mode, the form is empty and allows you to build a new quote.

==Delete==

Quote statuses can be deleted only if they are not currently in use.

Deactivation is preferred to preserve consistency in historical records.
