==Description==

The Leads application is used to register and track potential customers before they become actual clients.
It allows you to collect key information about each lead, such as contact details, origin, and current status in the sales process.
This module helps organize the pre-sales activity, enabling sales teams to follow up effectively, qualify opportunities,
and convert leads into customers when appropriate.
