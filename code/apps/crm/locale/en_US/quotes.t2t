==Description==

The Quotes application is used to create and manage commercial proposals sent to customers.
Each quote contains line items with products or services, pricing, taxes, and conditions.
This module is tightly integrated with Customers and Products, and allows for tracking the status of each quote
(e.g., Draft, Sent, Accepted). When a quote is accepted, it can be converted into an invoice.
