=Certificates=

==Description==

The Certificates application is used to manage and track SSL/TLS certificates stored or monitored by the system.

This module allows administrators to register certificates, store metadata, monitor expiration dates,
and ensure that security infrastructure remains up-to-date.

It is especially useful for managing certificates for custom domains, internal services, or external integrations.
