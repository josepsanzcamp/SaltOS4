=Purchase Status=

==Description==

The Purchase Status application defines the stages a purchase record can go through.
It allows categorizing purchases according to their state, such as "Draft", "Ordered", "Received", or "Cancelled".

These statuses help in tracking the progress of procurement processes and improve clarity in the Purchase module.

- Description: Clarifies how or when this status is used.
- Active: Indicates if the status is currently selectable.
