==Description==

The Emails application is used to receive, view, and reply to emails from configured accounts within SaltOS4.
It acts as a simplified integrated email client that supports reading messages from POP3 or IMAP,
viewing metadata and content, and replying using internal or external SMTP servers.

Each message is presented as a visual card in the list view, showing key fields such as sender, subject,
date, and a preview of the body. Emails can be viewed in detail, replied to, or deleted. This app is
closely integrated with the Emails Accounts module and is essential for managing inbound communication.

==List view==

- Subject: The title or subject line of the email message.

==PDF generation==

From the individual view of a record (view), the user can generate and download a PDF containing all relevant data of that entry.

From the list view (list), it is possible to select multiple records using the checkboxes and generate a single PDF that includes all of them.

==Widget on the dashboard==

The email application (`emails`) publishes a widget on the main dashboard that displays a compact list with the 5 most recently received emails.

This widget allows users to quickly review their most recent messages without entering the full application, improving visibility of recent activity and enabling direct access to each email.
