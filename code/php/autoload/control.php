/*
 * Make Control function
 *
 * This function allow to insert and delete the control registers associacted
 * to any application and to any register of the application
 *
 * @app => code of the application that you want to index
 * @reg_id => register of the app that you want to index
 * @user_id => user id of the owner of the app register
 * @datetime => time mark used as creation time of the app register
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * This function allow to pass a null reg_id, this trigger a query that get the
 * last_id used by the table, if the reg_id is an array, the function does
 * a recursive calls to add a control register to all ids of the reg_id array
 *
 * Too, you can pass a null user_id and/or null datetime, in these cases, the
 * function will determine the user_id and datetime automatically
 *
 * This function returns an integer as response about the control action:
 *
 * 1 => insert executed, this is because the app register exists and the indexing register not exists
 * 2 => delete executed, this is because the app register not exists and the indexing register exists
 * -1 => app not found, this is because the app requested not exists in the apps config
 * -2 => app not found, this is because the app requested not have a table in the apps config
 * -3 => control table not found, this is because the has_control feature is disabled by dbstatic
 * -4 => data not found, this is because the app register not exists and the control register too not exists
 * -5 => control exists, this is because the app register exists and the control register too exists
 *
