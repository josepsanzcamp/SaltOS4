 * id, name, size, type, data, error, file, hash
 *
 * This action checks that not error is found, checks the file element, the
 * size of the file, the hash of the file, and then, remove the file and
 * clear the file and hash element of the array
 *
 * @files => array of files, each element must contain the follow elements:
 * @id    => unique id that is used by the client to identify the response
 * @name  => the name of the file
 * @size  => the size of the file
 * @type  => the type of the file
 * @data  => the contents of the file encoded as inline base64
 * @error => the error in case of errors
 * @file  => this field is used here to put the local filename used in the file
 * @hash  => this field contains the hash of the contents of the file
