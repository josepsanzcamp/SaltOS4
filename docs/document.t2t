function will determine the user_id and datetime automatically

This function returns an integer as response about the control action:

- +1 => insert executed, this is because the app register exists and they can add a new version register
- +2 => delete executed, this is because the app register not exists and the version register exists
- -1 => app not found, this is because the app requested not have a table in the apps config
- -2 => version table not found, this is because the has_version feature is disabled by dbstatic

The fetch argument can perform an speed up in the execution of the retrieve action, and
can modify how the result is returned

auto: this fetch method try to detect if the resultset contains one or more columns, and
sets the fetch to column (if the resultset only contains one column) or to query (otherwise)

query: this fetch method returns all resultset as an array of rows, and each row contain the
pair of key val with the name of the field and the value of the field

column: this fetch method returns an array where each element is each value of the field of
the each row, this is useful when for example do you want to get all ids of a query, with
this method you can obtain an array with each value of the array is an id of the resultset

concat: this fetch method is an special mode intended to speed up the retrieve of large
arrays, this is useful when you want to get all ids of a query and you want to get a big
sized array, in this case, is more efficient to get an string separated by commas with all
ids instead of an array where each element is an id

YYYY-MM-DD

- @value => the input value to validate


Notes:

This function try to cast the year, month and day from 0000-00-00 to valid
values, this is because the databases accepts the 0000-00-00 date and is used
as emulated null, the month are limited to 12 and the day is limited to the
days of the month and year, this is useful because the dates that are more
greather that zero, will have a valid and an existing value

```

This function is a helper to the dbschema functions, to auto name the indexes

- @dbschema => the dbschema array


Notes:

This function allow to specify indexes only specifying the fields that you want
to conform the index, but the engines as MariaDB and SQLite, requires that each
index have a unique name, and for this reason, we add this feature to automate
this part of the process

You can see how the name of the index is different for MySQL and SQLite, this is
because in MySQL, the name can be repeated in different tables, but in SQLite,
the name must be unique in the database

This function uses the special feature in the helper that allow to
use as table parameter an app code to retrieve the field, this is
useful if you want some field of the app table and you want to use
the app code instead of the app table to identify what row do you
want to use


+++DB Static helper+++

function show_php_error($array)
```

This function allow to SaltOS to trigger the errors in a multiple levels:

1) Check if the error is caused by a memory allocation error, and in this case, try
to setup more memory to continue executing the error function, sometimes if the system
is using all memory, this function can not do all tasks and don't know whats be happening

2) Add some extra traces if they are not found in the input array

3) Create a human readable message in text and json format, the text will be used
to log the error using a regular file and the json will be used as stdout response

4) If the error is caused by a deprecation, the error will be logged in the log file
but the execution of the code will continue (if it can continue!!!)

5) Try to categorize the error and log the text in the specific log file, this part
is optimized to prevent the addition of repeated errors using a hash as a trick

6) Send a json to the stdout using the output handler.

THs input @array can contain pairs of key val:

- @dberror    => The text used in the DB Error section
- @phperror   => The text used in the PHP Error section
- @xmlerror   => The text used in the XML Error section

The unset for the pid and the time keys of the debug array is justificate
because each execution modify the pid and the time entries and break the
optimization of the hash with the checklog to prevent repetitions in the
log file

number of simple and double quotes must to be even

The arguments are the same that the strpos function

- @haystack => string where search the needle
- @needle   => the needle text that must be found in the haystack
- @offset   => bias applied to begin the search of the needle


+++Execute Query+++

```
function execute_query($query)
```

This function executes the query and depending in the result, returns the
resultset trying to do the more good combination in the return data

- @query => the SQL query that you want to execute


Note that the db_query is executed with the "auto" fetch mode, this causes
that the db_query returns an array with one dimension if the query only
generates a resultset with only one column, or returns an array with two
dimensions if the query generates a resultest with more that one column

To be more practice:

If you execute a query that select one field and only returns one row,
the return value will be the value of the field

If you execute a query that select one field and returns more that one
row, the return value will be an array of one dimension with all values
of this field

If you execute a query that select multiples fields and only return one
row, the return value will be an array of one dimension with all fields

Ig you execute a query that select multiples fields and returns more that
one row, the return value will be an array of two dimensions with all rows
and each row with all fields

Be carefully to use the output of this command in an foreach, for example
because you can get for the same query differents output types, if you
need to be more standarized in the output types, see the execute_query_array


+++Execute Query Array+++

```
function execute_query_array($query)
```

This function is the same that execute_query but guarantee that for the
same query, you get the same output type if the resultet contains one
row or more rows, useful is you want to use the output of this function
in a foreach, for example

- @query => the SQL query that you want to execute


+++Get Fields+++

function get_field_type($type)
```

This function returns an standarized type for the specific types used in
the real database, for example, returns string if the field is of TEXT type

- @type => the real type in the database


+++Get Field Size+++

```
function get_field_size($type)
```

This function returns the size for the types used in the database, for
example, returns 65535 if the field is of TEXT type

Returns the insert query for the table with all fields specified by the
array param

- @table => table where you want to add the register
- @array => array with key val pairs that represent the field and the value
          of the field


Notes:

This function tries to cast each value to their data type getting this
information from dbschema config, you can pass in array all fields that
you want and not is needed to put all fields of the table, only the
fields that appear in the array will be used in the insert, if some
field is not a part of the fields of the table, an error will be
triggered

This function uses the array_key_exists instead of isset because the
check of the $array[$name] fails when the item exists but is false or
null, for example


+++Make Update Query+++

```

Returns the update query for the table with all fields specified by the
array param and using the specified where

          the field
- @where => where clausule used to update only the expected registers, can be
          the output of make_where_query


Notes:

This function tries to cast each value to their data type getting this
information from dbschema config, you can pass in array all fields that
you want and not is needed to put all fields of the table, only the
fields that appear in the array will be used in the update, if some
field is not a part of the fields of the table, an error will be
triggered

This function uses the array_key_exists instead of isset because the
check of the $array[$name] fails when the item exists but is false or
null, for example


+++Make Where Query+++

```
function make_where_query($array)
```

This function allow to create where sentences joinin all fields by AND

- @array => array with key val pairs that represent the field and the value of
          the field


Notes:

The keys normally contains the name of the field, but if you need to use
a different comparison operator, you can use the field name and add the
operator that you want to use in the comparison, the allowed comparison
operators are >, <, =, >=, <=, !=


+++Escape Reserved Word+++

```
function escape_reserved_word($word)
```

This function tries to escape the reserved words that can not be used
in sql queries as field names or table names, currently is only used
to escape field names but in a future, if it is needed, can be added
to escape table names too

- @word => the word that must to be escape if needed


+++Make Like Query+++

```
function make_like_query($keys, $values, $args = [])

where condition to filter for the specified keys and values

- @keys    => an string with comma separated field names
- @values  => the value of the input search
- @minsize => the minimal size of the length used in each like
- @default => sql fraement returned if some thing was wrong


Notes:

This function generates a sequence of (like or like) and (like and like)
and is able to understand the prefix plus or minus in each word of the
search string, this allow to the function to use the like or not like
depending the sign of the word, and too to use the disjunction or
conjunction in each like group


+++Make Fulltext Query Helper+++

```
function __make_fulltext_query_helper($values, $args = [])
```

This function is similar to the make_like_query, but uses the match agains
clausule instead of the like clausule, the match agaings is used for
fulltext searches and generally, this function is not intended to be used
directly, it must acts as a helper of the make_fulltext_query

- @values  => the value of the input search
- @minsize => the minimal size of the length used in each like
- @default => sql fraement returned if some thing was wrong


Notes:

This function differs between the make_like_query in the idea that this
function only is used to search using fulltext indexes and in one unique
field named search


+++Make Fulltext Query+++

```
function make_fulltext_query($values, $app, $args = [])
```

While the two version returns the fragment that must to be added to the
query that search in the table that contains the search field, this function
allow to specify the same that the two version with two fields more, the
app and the prefix to be added to the id field of the in subquery

- @values  => the value of the input search
- @app     => the app used to detect the indexing table
- @prefix  => the prefix added to the id used in the in subquery
- @minsize => the minimal size of the length used in each like
- @default => sql fraement returned if some thing was wrong

This fie contains useful functions related to the xml manipulation, this code is a part of the
main version of the SaltOS because the main idea defined some years ago continues active, if you
compare this code, you can see more accuracy in the specification to be more specific and precise
but this code is a part of all the SaltOS versions


+++Eval Protected+++

```
function eval_protected($input, $global = "")
```

This function allow to execute PHP code using the eval function in a controlled
environment, you can specify some global variables to improve the eval execution

- @input  => the code to be executed
- @global => the list (separated by comma) of global variables that you want to use


+++Set Array+++

```
function set_array(&$array, $name, $value)
```

This function allow to specify multiples entries in an array with the same key,
to do this, the function will add #num where num is a unique number, in reality
if you want to set multiples entries for the key "test", you get in reality an
array with entries as "test", "test#1", "test#2"

This function works in concordance of the fix_key, that is able to get the key
as "test#1" and return only "test" that is the original key without the suffix
added to allow multiples instances of the same key in an associative array

- @array => array that you want to add the key with the value (by reference)
- @name  => the key used in the array, if exists, it will try to add the suffix to
          prevent collisions
- @value => the value that you want to set in this position of the array


+++Unset Array+++

```
function unset_array(&$array, $name)
```

This function remove all entries of the array that matches with the name of
the key, for example, if you specify the name "test", the function unset all
entries as "test" or begin by "test#", in the example of the previous function
will remove "test", "test#1" and "test#2"

- @array => array that you want to remove the key (by reference)
- @name  => the key used in the array and as prefix of the entries of the array


+++Fix Key+++

```
function fix_key($arg)
```

This function returns the "real" part of the key removing the suffix added to
prevent collisions in the associative array, for the above example, if you request
the fix_key of the "test#2", the function will returns "test"

- @arg => the name of the key that you want to remove the suffix part (if exists)


+++Detect Recursion+++

```
function detect_recursion($fn)
```

This function allow to SaltOS to detect the recursión, to do it, uses the debug_backtrace
function that returns all information about the execution of the current function, the
main idea of this function is to detect in what lines of the backtrace appear the file
or the function, and returns the count of times that appear

- @fn => the name of the function or file, can be multiples functions or files separated
       by a comma


+++XML File to Array+++

```
function xmlfile2array($file, $usecache = true)
```

This function allow to convert a XML file to an array, allow to use cache to
optimize repetitive calls of the same file

As an special mention, this function internally uses semaphores to prevent
multiple instances of the same execution with the same file, too uses a cache
management to optimize the usage

- @file     => the file that you want to convert from xml to array
- @usecache => if do you want to enable the cache feature


+++XML to Array+++

```
function xml2array($xml, $file = "")
```

This function allow to convert a XML string to an array

- @xml  => xml code to be converted to an array
- @file => filename of the contents, only used when an errors occurs


+++XML to Struct+++

```
function xml2struct($xml, $file = "")
```

This function is a helper of the xml2array function, the main purpose of this
function is to convert the xml string into a struct to be processed by the
struct2array function

The motivation to use the xml_parse_into_struct function is that this function
is the more quick to parse xml files, after a lot of tests, the more quickly
execution is to use the xml_parse_into_struct, reverse the array and then
program a simple recursive function that convert a unidimensional array into
a tree

At the begining of this function, we will try to detect the enconding of the
xml file, the main objective is to convert all xml to UTF-8 that is the default
enconding of SaltOS

The returned value is the result of the xml_parse_into_struct function, that is
the key of this feature and this function

- @xml  => xml fragment that must be converted into struct
- @file => the source filename, it is used only to generate error reports


+++Struct to Array+++

```
function struct2array(&$data, $file = "")
```

This function is the second part in the xml2array convertsion, here, the function
receives an unidimensional array with commands to open, close, and their respective
values and attributes, with this information, this function is able to generate a
tree with the xml converted to an array tree

- @data => the struct array, by reference
- @file => the source filename, it is used only to generate error reports


Notes:

This function uses recursivity to accomplish the objetive, returns the portion
of xml between the open and close command, in each call, the data array passed
by reference will decrement in size because the array_pop removes the last element
of the array

Remember that previously of call this function, the array is reversed, this is
because is more efficient to do a reverse and then pops instead of use directly
the array_shift to get the next element, the reason is that array_shift must to
reorder all keys of the resulted array and this add a very big cost if the xml
is big, this problem was detected in 2014 and was optimized by add the reverse
and the pop instead of only shift


+++Eval Attributes+++

```
function eval_attr($array)
```

This function is very special in SaltOS, is part of the initial code an
is used by a lot of parts of the program, currently are using a simplified
version of the original function and have improvements that allow to return
arrays with attributes without evaluate and without causing an error, this
allow to define xml with attributes that can be used by other processes and
SaltOS only interpret three attributes

- @array => the array that contains a tree representation of the xml


The three attributes are:

- @global => this attribute allow to SaltOS to prepare what variales must to
be global in the eval_protected call


- @eval => this attribute must be a boolean and allow to evaluate the value
of the node


- @ifeval => this attribute must contains an expression that must evaluate as
true or false, and allow to maintain or remove the entire node thas contains
the ifeval attribute, this is useful when you need a node in some conditions


The great change between the eval_attr of the previous versions of SaltOS is
that this version only accepts three internal commands and the other
attributes can be maintained in order to be used by other processes
(internally or externally)


+++Eval Bool+++

```
function eval_bool($arg)
```

This function returns a boolean depending on the input evaluation, the main idea
is to get an string, for example, and determine if must be considered true or false
otherwise will finish in an error

The valid inputs are the strings one, zero, void, true, false, on, off, yes and no

- @arg => the value that do you want to evaluates as boolean


++Main execution module++

```
api/php/autoload/zindex.php
```

This file contains the old index.php file, this was moved here to simplify the index.php and to
allow some php checks found in the current index.php

This code implements the main method to access to the SaltOS API using rest and json requests, to
use it, you can use the follow methods:

1) Rest using GET requests

This kind of requests requires that you send a GET request with a querystring of the follow
form:

- @https://127.0.0.1/saltos/code4/?app/invoices/view/2


And the system process it of the follow form:

- @rest/1 => invoices
- @rest/2 => view
- @rest/3 => 2


And you can programm any action that uses these parameters to do the desired task

2) Json using POST requests

This other kind of requests requires that you send a POST request with the appropiate header
for the content-type as application/json and a json in the body of the request, with this
call, saltos can map all contents of the json to the json/????? variables.

As an extra bonus, this module defines some usefull server variables used in a lot of
features of saltos, like the follow vars:

- @request_method => can be GET or POST
- @content_type   => used to check the content type for the JSON requests
- @token          => used to validate the HTTP_TOKEN send as authentication
- @remote_addr    => used internally for security reasons
- @user_agent     => used internally for security reasons


As a brief resume, you can use the follow keys in get_data or set_data:

- @rest                  => to get an array with all rest data, for the above example they
                          must return some thing like this:
                          ["app", "invoices", "view", "2"]
- @rest/1                => to get only the element that contains "invoices"
- @rest/2                => to get only the element that contains "view"
- @rest/3                => to get only the element that contains "2"
- @json                  => to get an array with all json data, for the above example they
                          must return some thing like this:
                          ["action"=>"authtoken", "user"=>"xxx", "pass"=>"xxx"]
- @json/action           => to get only the element that contains "authtoken"
- @json/user             => to get only the element that contains the user
- @json/pass             => to get only the element that contains the pass
- @server                => to get an array with all server data
- @server/request_method => can be GET or POST
- @server/content_type   => used to check the content type for the JSON requests
- @server/token          => used to validate the HTTP_TOKEN send as authentication
- @server/remote_addr    => used internally for security reasons
- @server/user_agent     => used internally for security reasons

locations where sometimes can contains a different structure, for example, when you want
to get the col div that contains a button with and without labels, depending on the
usage of the label, the component can contains a different structure and you may need
more or less parentNode calls, thanks to this function, the calls can be automated
returning the correct object of the structure with independence of the source of the
search.

- @obj    => the initial obj where do you want to do the search

- @name => the name of the event that you want to suscribe
- @fn   => callback executed when event named is triggered


+++Unset listener+++

```
saltos.tabs.unset_listener = (name)
```

This function removes a listener from the listeners object

- @name => the name of the event that you want to unsuscribe


+++Send message+++

```
saltos.tabs.send = (name, data)
```

This function allow to send a message to all tabs using the name and data
as event and argument of the callback executed.

- @name => the name of the event that you want to send
- @data => the arguments used by the callback function


Notes:

The usage of the localStorage causes the execution of the onstorage function
of the other tabs but not for the tab that send the message, to fix this we
are dispatching an event in the current window, this allow that all tabs
(including the source of the message sent) receives the notification and
executes the listeners if needed


+++Storage management+++

```
saltos.tabs.onstorage = event
```

This function allow to SaltOS to receive the messages sended by other tabs
using the localStorage.


+++Storage management+++

```
window.onstorage = saltos.tabs.onstorage;
```

Attach the storage management function to the window

- @label    => this parameter is used as text for the label


Notes:

This function defines the yellow color used for the hover and active rows.

The header field must be an object with the labels, types, aligns, ..., of each field,
if the header is ommited, then the data will be painted using the default order of the
data without filters, the recomendation is to use header to specify which fields must
to be painted, the order, the type and the alignment.

The divider will be added dynamically depending the contents of the table, the main idea
is to use the divider to separate each block of the table (header, data and footer)

The actions will be added using a dropdown menu if more than one action appear in the
the row data, the idea of this feature is to prevent that the icons uses lot of space
of the row data, and for this reason, it will define the dropdown variable that enables
or not the contraction feature

The elements of the data cells can contains an object with the field specification used
to the saltos.bootstrap.field constructor, it is usefull to convert some fields to inputs
instead of simple text, too is able to use the type attribute in the header specification
to identify if you want to use a column with some special type as for example, the icons

- @msg => the message that do you want to log on the server log file


+++Check params+++

```
saltos.core.check_params = (obj, params, value)
```

This function allow to prepare parameters to be used by other functions, the main idea
is that the other functions can access to properties of an object without getting errors
caused by the nonexistence, to do this, checks for the existence of all params in the obj
and if some param is not found, then define it using the default value passed:

- @obj    => the object that contains the arguments, for example
- @params => an array with the arguments that must to exists
- @value  => the default value used if an argument doesn't exists


+++UniqID+++

```

This function allow to create an DOM fragment from a string that contains html code, can
work with one or two arguments:

- @type => the type used when create the container element
- @html => contains the html code that you want to use as template


The main use is only using the html argument and omiting the type, in this case, the
type used will be a div, but if you want to create a fragment of object, for example
as tr or td, you need to specify that the coontainer type used to create the objects
must to be a table or tr, is you don't specify the type, the div container creates
a breaked portion of the element and they don't works as expected because the DOM
builded is bad, you can see this problem in action when work with tables and try to
create separate portions of the table as trs or tds.


+++AJAX+++

```
saltos.core.fix_key = arg
```

This function is intended to fix the keys of the objects, this is caused because you can not
have 2 repeated keys in an object, to have more entries with the same name, SaltOS add a suffix
by adding #num, with this trick, SaltOS is able to process XML files with the same node name
and convert it to an array structure, and when convert this to json, the same problem appear and
for this reason, exists this function here

- @arg => can be an string or an array of strings and returns the same structure with the keys fixed

desired file intead of create the object and throwing an error.

- @file => the file desired to be loaded


Notes:

This function is intended to load styles (css files) or javacript code (js files), in each
case, they uses a different technique, for css the load is asynchronous and for javascript
the load will be synchronous.


+++Eval Bool+++

```
saltos.core.eval_bool = arg
```

This function returns a boolean depending on the input evaluation, the main idea
is to get an string, for example, and determine if must be considered true or false
otherwise returns the original argument and send a log message to the console.

The valid inputs are the strings one, zero, void, true, false, on, off, yes and no

- @arg => the value that do you want to evaluates as boolean
