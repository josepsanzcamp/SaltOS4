++Config helper module++

```
api/php/autoload/config.php
```

This fie contains useful functions related to configuration features


+++Get config+++

```
function get_config($key, $user_id = -1)
```

This function is intended to be used to retrieve values from the config
system, as first level, the function try to get the value from the
tbl_config, and if it is not found, then the function try to get the
values from the config file.

- @key     => the key that you want to retrieve the value
- @user_id => the user_id used in the first search step


Notes:

This function is a new release of the olds getConfig and getDefault,
depending of the user_id argument, it tries to search in the config file or
in the database, for negative values the function uses the config file and
for zero or positive values, tries to search it in the database

To prevent errors in case of duplicates, we are using the ORDER BY id ASC
LIMIT 1, this allow to get and set only the first register found by the
select query


+++Set config+++

```
function set_config($key, $val, $user_id = -1)
```

This function sets a value to a config key, the data will be stored in the
database using the tbl_config for zero or positive values of user_id, and
in the memory of the config file for negative user_id values

- @key     => the key that you want to set
- @val     => the value that you want to set
- @user_id => the user_id used as filter


Notes:

If null val is passed as argument, then the entry of the config or database
is removed, the main idea is to use the same method used by the setcookie
that allow to remove entries by setting the value to null

To prevent errors in case of duplicates, we are using the ORDER BY id ASC
LIMIT 1, this allow to get and set only the first register found by the
select query


+++Detect config files+++

```
function detect_config_files($file)
```

This function returns the files found in the main path, in the apps path and in the files path

- @file => the pattern used to search files


+++Get config array+++

```
function get_config_array($prefix, $user_id)
```

This function is intended to retrieve the configuration associated to an user
using a prefix for all keys.

- @prefix  => the prefix used in the keys of the config
- @user_id => the user_id used in the search query


+++Prepare Config Files+++

```
function prepare_config_files($array)
```

This function tries to join all config files into one unique structure, to do it
joins nodes with the same key, for example, you can use the data/files/config.xml
file to set the specific database configuration and overwrite the db/pdo_mysql or
the db/type, the main idea is to replace the nodes of the second level because the
arrays2array function join previously the differents files into one structure usin
the first level to do the join, and only adds the repeated overload without take
decisions about overwrite the contents like this function do

- @array => the main array that you want to prepare as config array


++Database helper module++

```
api/php/autoload/database.php
```

This fie contains useful functions related to database, allow to connect, check queries, execute
queries, disconnect, retrieve rows and manipulate resultsets of the database

- @port => the port used for the connection
- @name => name of the database for the connection
- @user => user used to stablish the connection
- @pass => pass used to stablish the connection
- @file => the file that contains the database


Notes:

The parameters can be different depending of each database driver, in general the arguments can
be the host, port, name, user and pass for database's servers and only file for the sqlite database

If the args argument is null, the the function try to use the configuration stored in the config file
and depending of the argument presense, it will return the database object or store it in the config
to be used by the nexts functions of this php file


+++DB Check+++

```
function db_check($query, $params = [])

+++DB Query+++

```
function db_query($query, ...$args)
```

This public function is intended to execute the query and returns the resultset

- @query => the query that you want to execute
- @fetch => the type of fetch that you want to use, can be auto, query, column or concat


Notes:

The fetch argument can perform an speed up in the execution of the retrieve action, and
can modify how the result is returned

auto: this fetch method try to detect if the resultset contains one or more columns, and
sets the fetch to column (if the resultset only contains one column) or to query (otherwise)

query: this fetch method returns all resultset as an array of rows, and each row contain the
pair of key val with the name of the field and the value of the field

column: this fetch method returns an array where each element is each value of the field of
the each row, this is useful when for example do you want to get all ids of a query, with
this method you can obtain an array with each value of the array is an id of the resultset

concat: this fetch method is an special mode intended to speed up the retrieve of large
arrays, this is useful when you want to get all ids of a query and you want to get a big
sized array, in this case, is more efficient to get an string separated by commas with all
ids instead of an array where each element is an id


+++DB Fetch Row+++

```
function db_fetch_row(&$result)
```

This function returns the next row of the resultset queue

- @result => this argument is passed by reference and contains the resultset queue

YYYY-MM-DD

- @value => the input value to validate


Notes:

This function try to cast the year, month and day from 0000-00-00 to valid
values, this is because the databases accepts the 0000-00-00 date and is used
as emulated null, the month are limited to 12 and the day is limited to the
days of the month and year, this is useful because the dates that are more
greather that zero, will have a valid and an existing value


+++Day of a Month helper+++

errors, too contains the code used for the error and exception handlers


+++Show PHP Error+++

```
function show_php_error($array)
```

This function allow to SaltOS to trigger the errors in a multiple levels:

1) Check if the error is caused by a memory allocation error, and in this case, try
to setup more memory to continue executing the error function, sometimes if the system
is using all memory, this function can not do all tasks and don't know whats be happening

2) Add some extra traces if they are not found in the input array

3) Create a human readable message in text and json format, the text will be used
to log the error using a regular file and the json will be used as stdout response

4) If the error is caused by a deprecation, the error will be logged in the log file
but the execution of the code will continue (if it can continue!!!)

5) Try to categorize the error and log the text in the specific log file, this part
is optimized to prevent the addition of repeated errors using a hash as a trick

6) Send a json to the stdout using the output handler.

THs input @array can contain pairs of key val:

- @dberror    => The text used in the DB Error section
- @phperror   => The text used in the PHP Error section
- @xmlerror   => The text used in the XML Error section

- @backtrace  => The text used in the Backtrace section
- @debug      => The text used in the Debug section


Notes:

The unset for the pid and the time keys of the debug array is justificate
because each execution modify the pid and the time entries and break the
optimization of the hash with the checklog to prevent repetitions in the
log file


+++Do Message Error+++

```
function do_message_error($array)
```

This function acts as a helper of the show_php_error, is intended to build
the text and the json messages used to the log file and for the stdout channel

error is in the stack of the errors events, to do it this function uses the error_get_last
to check if the value in in the list of typified errors


+++Get code from trace+++

```
function __get_code_from_trace()
```

This function acts as helper of the show_json_error, and try to get the filename and the line
where the error will be triggered, for example, an error triggered from the index.php at line

to help the users when live issues with our API

- @trace => the array returned by the debug_backtrace function
- @index => the position of the array used to get the filename and the line


Notes:

This function gets the arguments dinamically, this allow to send for example the array with
the trace, the desired index or both datas in your prefered order, the trick to detect each
param is to expect an array for the trace and a number for the index.


+++Show JSON Error+++

```
function show_json_error($msg, $logout = false)
```

This function is triggered from the code in a controlate errors, the idea is to have
a simple way to send controled errors to the user using a json output channel, and to

- @expires => the expires time used to compute if the cache is valid


This funtion tries to execute the command using some of the
provided methods, passthru, system, exec and shell_exec, another
feature is that the function detects what command are available
to use


+++Check Commands+++

- @array => the array with the pairs of keys vals


+++According to the documentation, putenv must return false in error cases, but+++

```
if ($key == '' || putenv("$key=$val") === false) {
```


putenv(): Argument #1 ($assignment) must have a valid syntax (code 0)

For this reason, the show_php_error placed after the putenv that must to
be executed when putenv returns false never can be executed.

As trick, I have added the void key condition to force a case that executes
the show_php_error


+++Eval Extras+++

```
function eval_extras($array)
```

This function evaluates the extra init requirements, intended for the multibyte
functions and for the gettext initialization process

Notes:

This function uses a trick to convert numbers in scientific notation to an old
decimal style, to do it, detects numbers with the e letter and print using the
%.16f, this is used in sprintf to format floating-point numbers with 16 decimal
places, ensuring precision up to the typical limit of a double type in C, which
supports approximately 15-17 significant digits


++Log helper module++

```
api/php/autoload/log.php
```

This fie contains useful functions related to the logs files, allowing to add and check contents
to the logs file, useful for debug purposes


+++Check Log+++

```
function checklog($hash, $file)
```

This function is a helper for the show_php_error, allow to detect repetitions
of the same text in the log file to prevent to add repeated lines, the usage
is very simple, only requires a hash and a file to check that the hash is not
found in the contents of the file, you can think in this function as a grep
replacement that is able to found the hash in the file

- @hash => the pattern that you want to search in the file
- @file => the file where search the pattern


+++Add Log+++

```
function addlog($msg, $file = '')
```

This function add messages to the specified log file

- @msg  => message that you want to add to the log file
- @file => the log file that you want to use without directory


Notes:

If not file is specified, the debug/logfile (saltos.log) is used by default

The logs files are stored in the logsdir (/data/logs)

This function performs the log rotation is the maxfilesize is reached


+++Add Trace+++

```
function addtrace($array, $file)
```

This function performs the addlog to the file using as input the array, the
main idea is to pass the same array that the used in the show_php_error, the
difference is that addtrace, only add the backtrace and debug to the array
and then, saves the log to the specified file

- @array => the array that can contains the same info that show_php_error
- @file  => the file where do you want to store the log contents


+++Get Trace+++

```
function gettrace(...$args)
```

This function get an array as show_php_error, add the backtrace and debug
information and convert all array into a string

- @array => the array that can contains the same info that show_php_error
- @full  => add the full debug backtrace instead of the generic partial


This differentiation is because the full debug backtrace can break the
checklog feature because the time and pid can be different in each
execution


+++Session Backtrace+++

```
function session_backtrace()
```

Returns a string with the pid, sessid and current datetime with decimals

Notes:

The fields of this array allow to do low level debug processes, this data is
generally used by the semaphores and some forced addtrace calls, but causes
problems in the error reporting because break the hash and checklog optimization


++Memory helper module++

the entire management of the database (create tables, drop tables, create indexes, and more),
too allow to prepare sql queries suck inserts, updates or wheres fragments that are procected
to external injections, for example, by escaping all special characters.

Too it provides functions to do subparts of the where queries suck as special likes combinations
or match again combinations for the fulltext search engine, see all detailed information by
reading the list of functions of this module


+++Parse Query+++

```
function parse_query($query, $type = '')
```

This function is intended to apply the query filters defined by the users
when write queries for multiples db engines as MySQL and/or SQLite, for
example, if you want to write a fragment of SQL with one version for MySQL
and another version for SQLite, you can do / *MYSQL ... * // *SQLite ... * /

Note that the previous example add a spaces between the bar and the asterisc
because we can not put comments inside another comment!!!

- @query => the query that must be parsed
- @type  => the db type that you want to allow by the filters


+++Parse Query Type helper+++

```

This function is the same that strpos, but with some improvements required
by the parse_query funcion, the idea is to use the strpos functionality, but
controlling that the found position must acomplish some constraints as the
number of simple and double quotes must to be even

The arguments are the same that the strpos function

- @haystack => string where search the needle
- @needle   => the needle text that must be found in the haystack
- @offset   => bias applied to begin the search of the needle


+++Execute Query+++

```
function execute_query($query, $params = null)
```

This function executes the query and depending in the result, returns the
resultset trying to do the more good combination in the return data

- @query => the SQL query that you want to execute


Note that the db_query is executed with the "auto" fetch mode, this causes
that the db_query returns an array with one dimension if the query only
generates a resultset with only one column, or returns an array with two
dimensions if the query generates a resultest with more that one column

To be more practice:

If you execute a query that select one field and only returns one row,
the return value will be the value of the field

If you execute a query that select one field and returns more that one
row, the return value will be an array of one dimension with all values
of this field

If you execute a query that select multiples fields and only return one
row, the return value will be an array of one dimension with all fields

Ig you execute a query that select multiples fields and returns more that
one row, the return value will be an array of two dimensions with all rows
and each row with all fields

Be carefully to use the output of this command in an foreach, for example
because you can get for the same query differents output types, if you
need to be more standarized in the output types, see the execute_query_array


+++Execute Query Array+++

```
function execute_query_array($query, $params = null)
```

This function is the same that execute_query but guarantee that for the
same query, you get the same output type if the resultet contains one
row or more rows, useful is you want to use the output of this function
in a foreach, for example

- @query => the SQL query that you want to execute


+++Get Fields+++

+++Get Field Size+++

```
function get_field_size($type)
```

This function returns the size for the types used in the database, for
example, returns 65535 if the field is of TEXT type

Notes:

In general, type1 is used to detect the size of text fields, the type2
is used for VARCHAR(X) that specify the size of the VARCHAR in the type2
parameter.

Returns the insert query for the table with all fields specified by the
array param

- @table => table where you want to add the register
- @array => array with key val pairs that represent the field and the value
          of the field


Notes:

This function tries to cast each value to their data type getting this
information from dbschema config, you can pass in array all fields that
you want and not is needed to put all fields of the table, only the
fields that appear in the array will be used in the insert, if some
field is not a part of the fields of the table, an error will be
triggered

This function uses the array_key_exists instead of isset because the
check of the $array[$name] fails when the item exists but is false or
null, for example


+++Make Update Query+++

```
function make_update_query($table, $array, $where)
```

Returns the update query for the table with all fields specified by the
array param and using the specified where

- @table => table where you want to update the register
- @array => array with key val pairs that represent the field and the value of
          the field
- @where => array with key val pairs that represent the field and the value of
          the field used in the where part of the query


Notes:

This function tries to cast each value to their data type getting this
information from dbschema config, you can pass in array all fields that
you want and not is needed to put all fields of the table, only the
fields that appear in the array will be used in the update, if some
field is not a part of the fields of the table, an error will be
triggered

This function uses the array_key_exists instead of isset because the
check of the $array[$name] fails when the item exists but is false or
null, for example


+++Make Where Query+++

```
function make_where_query($table, $array)
```

This function allow to create where sentences joinin all fields by AND

- @table => table where you want to apply the where
- @array => array with key val pairs that represent the field and the value of
          the field


Notes:

The keys normally contains the name of the field, but if you need to use
a different comparison operator, you can use the field name and add the
operator that you want to use in the comparison, the allowed comparison
operators are >, <, =, >=, <=, !=


+++Escape Reserved Word+++

```
function escape_reserved_word($word)

This function tries to escape the reserved words that can not be used
in sql queries as field names or table names, currently is only used
to escape field names but in a future, if it is needed, can be added
to escape table names too

- @word => the word that must to be escape if needed


Notes:

If you use an array as argument, then the function is applied to all
elements of the array.


+++Make Like Query+++

```
function make_like_query($keys, $values, $args = [])
```

This function is intended to returns the sql fragment to be added to
the where condition to filter for the specified keys and values

- @keys    => an string with comma separated field names
- @values  => the value of the input search
- @minsize => the minimal size of the length used in each like
- @default => sql fraement returned if some thing was wrong


Notes:

This function generates a sequence of (like or like) and (like and like)
and is able to understand the prefix plus or minus in each word of the
search string, this allow to the function to use the like or not like
depending the sign of the word, and too to use the disjunction or
conjunction in each like group


+++Make Fulltext Query Helper+++

```
function __make_fulltext_query_helper($values, $args = [])
```

This function is similar to the make_like_query, but uses the match agains
clausule instead of the like clausule, the match agaings is used for
fulltext searches and generally, this function is not intended to be used
directly, it must acts as a helper of the make_fulltext_query

- @values  => the value of the input search
- @minsize => the minimal size of the length used in each like
- @default => sql fraement returned if some thing was wrong


Notes:

This function differs between the make_like_query in the idea that this
function only is used to search using fulltext indexes and in one unique
field named search


+++Make Fulltext Query+++

```
function make_fulltext_query($values, $app, $args = [])
```

While the two version returns the fragment that must to be added to the
query that search in the table that contains the search field, this function
allow to specify the same that the two version with two fields more, the
app and the prefix to be added to the id field of the in subquery

- @values  => the value of the input search
- @app     => the app used to detect the indexing table
- @prefix  => the prefix added to the id used in the in subquery
- @minsize => the minimal size of the length used in each like

compare this code, you can see more accuracy in the specification to be more specific and precise
but this code is a part of all the SaltOS versions


+++Set Array+++

```
function set_array(&$array, $name, $value)
```

This function allow to specify multiples entries in an array with the same key,
to do this, the function will add #num where num is a unique number, in reality
if you want to set multiples entries for the key "test", you get in reality an
array with entries as "test", "test#1", "test#2"

This function works in concordance of the fix_key, that is able to get the key
as "test#1" and return only "test" that is the original key without the suffix
added to allow multiples instances of the same key in an associative array

- @array => array that you want to add the key with the value (by reference)
- @name  => the key used in the array, if exists, it will try to add the suffix to
          prevent collisions
- @value => the value that you want to set in this position of the array


+++Unset Array+++

```
function unset_array(&$array, $name)
```

This function remove all entries of the array that matches with the name of
the key, for example, if you specify the name "test", the function unset all
entries as "test" or begin by "test#", in the example of the previous function
will remove "test", "test#1" and "test#2"

- @array => array that you want to remove the key (by reference)
- @name  => the key used in the array and as prefix of the entries of the array


+++Fix Key+++

```
function fix_key($arg)
```

This function returns the "real" part of the key removing the suffix added to
prevent collisions in the associative array, for the above example, if you request
the fix_key of the "test#2", the function will returns "test"

- @arg => the name of the key that you want to remove the suffix part (if exists)


+++XML Files to Array+++

```
function xmlfiles2array($files, $usecache = true)
```

This function allow to convert all XML files to an array, allow to use cache to
optimize repetitive calls of the same file

As an special mention, this function internally implements the old xml_join feature
that allow to merge multiple files into one using the fix_key of the keys in the first
level as key to join.

- @files    => the files that you want to convert from xml to array
- @usecache => if do you want to enable the cache feature


Notes:
- The arrays2array function is derived from this function that get all arguments and
  process the contents to join with a certain logics


+++XML File to Array+++

```
function xmlfile2array($file, $usecache = true)
```

This function allow to convert a XML file to an array, allow to use cache to
optimize repetitive calls of the same file

As an special mention, this function internally uses semaphores to prevent
multiple instances of the same execution with the same file, too uses a cache
management to optimize the usage

- @file     => the file that you want to convert from xml to array
- @usecache => if do you want to enable the cache feature


+++XML to Array+++

```
function xml2array($xml, $file = '')
```

This function allow to convert a XML string to an array

- @xml  => xml code to be converted to an array
- @file => filename of the contents, only used when an errors occurs


+++XML to Struct+++

```
function xml2struct($xml, $file = '')
```

This function is a helper of the xml2array function, the main purpose of this
function is to convert the xml string into a struct to be processed by the
struct2array function

The motivation to use the xml_parse_into_struct function is that this function
is the more quick to parse xml files, after a lot of tests, the more quickly
execution is to use the xml_parse_into_struct, reverse the array and then
program a simple recursive function that convert a unidimensional array into
a tree

At the begining of this function, we will try to detect the enconding of the
xml file, the main objective is to convert all xml to UTF-8 that is the default
enconding of SaltOS

The returned value is the result of the xml_parse_into_struct function, that is
the key of this feature and this function

- @xml  => xml fragment that must be converted into struct
- @file => the source filename, it is used only to generate error reports


+++Struct to Array+++

```
function struct2array(&$data, $file = '')
```

This function is the second part in the xml2array convertsion, here, the function
receives an unidimensional array with commands to open, close, and their respective
values and attributes, with this information, this function is able to generate a
tree with the xml converted to an array tree

- @data => the struct array, by reference
- @file => the source filename, it is used only to generate error reports


Notes:

This function uses recursivity to accomplish the objetive, returns the portion
of xml between the open and close command, in each call, the data array passed
by reference will decrement in size because the array_pop removes the last element
of the array

Remember that previously of call this function, the array is reversed, this is
because is more efficient to do a reverse and then pops instead of use directly
the array_shift to get the next element, the reason is that array_shift must to
reorder all keys of the resulted array and this add a very big cost if the xml
is big, this problem was detected in 2014 and was optimized by add the reverse
and the pop instead of only shift


+++Eval Attributes+++

```
function eval_attr($array, $recursive = true)
```

This function is very special in SaltOS, is part of the initial code an
is used by a lot of parts of the program, currently are using a simplified
version of the original function and have improvements that allow to return
arrays with attributes without evaluate and without causing an error, this
allow to define xml with attributes that can be used by other processes and
SaltOS only interpret three attributes

- @array => the array that contains a tree representation of the xml


The three attributes are:

- @eval => this attribute must be a boolean and allow to evaluate the value
of the node


- @ifeval => this attribute must contains an expression that must evaluate as
true or false, and allow to maintain or remove the entire node thas contains
the ifeval attribute, this is useful when you need a node in some conditions


- @require => this attribute allow to SaltOS to add code to the current exec
context and is intended to load code that will then be used by the eval feature


The great change between the eval_attr of the previous versions of SaltOS is
that this version only accepts three internal commands and the other
attributes can be maintained in order to be used by other processes
(internally or externally)


+++Eval Bool+++

```
function eval_bool($arg)
```

This function returns a boolean depending on the input evaluation, the main idea
is to get an string, for example, and determine if must be considered true or false
otherwise will finish in an error

The valid inputs are the strings one, zero, void, true, false, on, off, yes and no

- @arg => the value that do you want to evaluates as boolean

++Main execution module++

```
api/php/autoload/zindex.php
```

This file contains the old index.php file, this was moved here to simplify the index.php and to
allow some php checks found in the current index.php

This code implements the main method to access to the SaltOS API using rest and json requests, to
use it, you can use the follow methods:

1) Rest using GET requests

This kind of requests requires that you send a GET request with a querystring of the follow
form:

- @https://127.0.0.1/saltos/code4/?app/invoices/view/2


And the system process it of the follow form:

- @rest/1 => invoices
- @rest/2 => view
- @rest/3 => 2


And you can programm any action that uses these parameters to do the desired task

2) Json using POST requests

This other kind of requests requires that you send a POST request with the appropiate header
for the content-type as application/json and a json in the body of the request, with this
call, saltos can map all contents of the json to the json/????? variables.

As an extra bonus, this module defines some useful server variables used in a lot of
features of saltos, like the follow vars:

- @request_method => can be GET or POST
- @content_type   => used to check the content type for the JSON requests
- @token          => used to validate the HTTP_TOKEN send as authentication
- @remote_addr    => used internally for security reasons
- @user_agent     => used internally for security reasons


As a brief resume, you can use the follow keys in get_data or set_data:

- @rest                  => to get an array with all rest data, for the above example they
                          must return some thing like this:
                          ["app", "invoices", "view", "2"]
- @rest/1                => to get only the element that contains "invoices"
- @rest/2                => to get only the element that contains "view"
- @rest/3                => to get only the element that contains "2"
- @json                  => to get an array with all json data, for the above example they
                          must return some thing like this: ["user"=>"xxx", "pass"=>"xxx"]
- @json/user             => to get only the element that contains the user
- @json/pass             => to get only the element that contains the pass
- @server                => to get an array with all server data
- @server/request_method => can be GET or POST
- @server/content_type   => used to check the content type for the JSON requests
- @server/token          => used to validate the HTTP_TOKEN send as authentication
- @server/remote_addr    => used internally for security reasons
- @server/user_agent     => used internally for security reasons

Notes:

The fetch argument can perform an speed up in the execution of the retrieve action, and
can modify how the result is returned

auto: this fetch method try to detect if the resultset contains one or more columns, and
sets the fetch to column (if the resultset only contains one column) or to query (otherwise)

query: this fetch method returns all resultset as an array of rows, and each row contain the
pair of key val with the name of the field and the value of the field

column: this fetch method returns an array where each element is each value of the field of
the each row, this is useful when for example do you want to get all ids of a query, with

This function allow to add a new version to a reg_id of an app, to do it,
the function requires to specify the app, reg_id, the original data and
the new data to compute the diff patch that must to be stored in the data
field and create the register for the new version

To do this, the function validate the input data, checks the existence
of registers of data and versions, prepare the data patch to store, get
the old hash to do the blockchain, get the last ver_id and compute all
needed things to do the insert of the new version register

- @app    => code of the application that you want to add a new version
- @reg_id => register of the app that you want to add a new version


Notes:

This function returns an integer as response about the control action:

- +1 => insert executed, this is because the app register exists and they can add a new version register
- -1 => app not found, this is because the app requested not have a table in the apps config
- -2 => version table not found, this is because the has_version feature is disabled by dbstatic
- -3 => data not found and version not found, app register not exists and version register not exists
- -4 => data not found but version found, app register not exists and version register exists


As you can see, negative values denotes an error and positive values denotes a successfully situation


+++Get Version+++

```
function get_version($app, $reg_id, $ver_id = null)
```

This function allow to get an specific version of a register and app, intended
to get the data used in a specific version to compare with other versions and
to restore data to the requested version

- @app    => code of the application that you want to add a new version
- @reg_id => register of the app that you want to add a new version
- @ver_id => the version that you want to get


Notes:

This function is not a simple select of the register that matches with the
ver_id requested, it does an accumulative merge to get the register data
in the moment where the version will be stored, to do it, they must to
restore versions from 1 to ver_id, and must to discard the next versions

This function returns an array or an integer as response about the control action:

- -1 => app not found, this is because the app requested not have a table in the apps config
- -2 => version table not found, this is because the has_version feature is disabled by dbstatic
- -3 => data not found, this is because the version requested not exists


As you can see, negative values denotes an error and positive values denotes a successfully situation


+++Delete Version function+++

```
function del_version($app, $reg_id)
```

This function allow to delete the last version to a reg_id of an app, to do it,
the function requires to specify the app and reg_id

- @app    => code of the application that you want to add a new version
- @reg_id => register of the app that you want to add a new version


Notes:

This function returns an integer as response about the control action:

- +1 => delete executed, this is because the app register exists and they can delete the last register
- -1 => app not found, this is because the app requested not have a table in the apps config
- -2 => version table not found, this is because the has_version feature is disabled by dbstatic
- -3 => data not found, this is because the app register not exists and the version register not exists


As you can see, negative values denotes an error and positive values denotes a successfully situation

type used will be a div, but if you want to create a fragment of object, for example
as tr or td, you need to specify that the coontainer type used to create the objects
must to be a table or tr, is you don't specify the type, the div container creates
a breaked portion of the element and they don't works as expected because the DOM
builded is bad, you can see this problem in action when work with tables and try to
create separate portions of the table as trs or tds.

```
saltos.core.__ajax = [];
```

This array allow to the ajax feature to manage the active request, intended to abort
if it is needed when onhashchange.


+++AJAX+++

```
saltos.core.ajax = args
```

This function allow to use ajax using the same form that with jQuery without jQuery

- @url          => url of the ajax call
- @data         => data used in the body of the request
- @method       => the method of the request (can be GET or POST, GET by default)
- @success      => callback function for the success action (optional)
- @error        => callback function for the error action (optional)
- @abort        => callback function for the abort action (optional)
- @abortable    => boolean to enable or disable the abort feature (false by default)
- @content_type => the content-type that you want to use in the transfer
- @proxy        => add the Proxy header with the value passed, intended to be used by the SaltOS PROXY
- @token        => add the Token header with the value passed, intended to be used by the SaltOS API
- @lang         => add the Lang header with the value passed, intended to be used by the SaltOS API
- @headers      => an object with the headers that you want to send


The main idea of this function is to abstract the usage of the XMLHttpRequest in a simple
way as jQuery do but without using jQuery.

The catch part is intended to control the errors caused during the ajax execution,
in this case is important to understand that the catch can be triggered by errors
caused by network errors or by other cases like a code error, a throw new error or
something similar like this, to fix it, the error and abort arguments will be used
only when abortError or typeError appear in the error.name


+++Fix key+++

```
saltos.core.fix_key = arg
```

This function is intended to fix the keys of the objects, this is caused because you can not
have 2 repeated keys in an object, to have more entries with the same name, SaltOS add a suffix
by adding #num, with this trick, SaltOS is able to process XML files with the same node name
and convert it to an array structure, and when convert this to json, the same problem appear and
for this reason, exists this function here

- @arg => can be an string or an array of strings and returns the same structure with the keys fixed

This function is intended to load styles (css files) or javacript code (js files), in each
case, they uses a different technique, for css the load is asynchronous and for javascript
the load will be synchronous.


+++Eval Bool+++

```
saltos.core.eval_bool = arg

is to get an string, for example, and determine if must be considered true or false
otherwise returns the original argument and send a log message to the console.

The valid inputs are the strings one, zero, void, true, false, on, off, yes and no

- @arg => the value that do you want to evaluates as boolean


Notes:

If the content of value is only a string, then the result will be an array with the
elements of the #attr joined with a new element with the name value and with the contents
of the original value.


+++Encode Bar Chars+++

```
saltos.core.encode_bad_chars = (cad, pad = '_', extra = '')
```

This function tries to replace accender chars and other extended chars into
an ascii chars, to do it, they define an array with the pairs of chars to
do a quick replace, too is converted all to lower and are removed all chars
that are out of range (valid range are from 0-9 and from a-z), the function
allow to specify an extra parameter to add extra chars that must to be
allowed in the output, all other chars will be converted to the padding
argument, as a bonus extra, all padding repetitions will be removed to
only allow one pading char at time

- @cad   => the input string to encode
- @pad   => the padding char using to replace the bar chars
- @extra => the list of chars allowed to appear in the output

channels, this is usefull to detect certificate issues

Notes:

The first version uses fetch to the img/logo_saltos.svg but for securiry reasons,
the browser never send the request to http from https or viceversa, the unique trick
that I found to do it is to open a new window for each protocol and wait for the
expected result

- @data  => the arguments used by the callback function
- @scope => the scope where the event must to be triggered (me, all, other)


Notes:

The usage of the localStorage causes the execution of the onstorage function
of the other tabs but not for the tab that send the message, to fix this we
are dispatching an event in the current window, this allow that all tabs
(including the source of the message sent) receives the notification and
executes the listeners if needed

As this module uses the saltos.storage module, it's important that understand
that the saltos.storage adds a prefix in the keys to allow the separation of
the data for the different instances of the same app, this is important because
the key generated to send the event to the origin of the message must contains
the prefix that too


+++Storage management+++

```
window.addEventListener('storage', event
```

This function allow to SaltOS to receive the messages sended by other tabs
using the localStorage.
