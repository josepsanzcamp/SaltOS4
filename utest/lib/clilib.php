/**
 * Test CLI helper
 *
 * This function allow to execute SaltOS using the CLI SAPI, to do it, the function
 * detects if data is provided, and executes the command and getting the output of
 * the execution. If data exists, then the contents are stored in a file and passed
 * the contents of the file to the stdin of the php process to emmulate the input
 * channel used by the apache server.
 *
 * As an example, this functions tries to execute the command using the follow formula:
 *
 * 1) php index.php $rest
 *
 * 2) cat /tmp/input | php index.php $rest
 *
 * In addition, the token field is used to define the TOKEN environment variable that
 * is used by SaltOS as variable to emmulate the TOKEN used by the apache for authenticate
 * the SaltOS app.
 *
 * @rest  => The rest request, like update/customers/3
 * @data  => The data used as json in the SaltOS app
 * @token => The token used if authentication is required
